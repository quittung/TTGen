# Data Files
 - data folder should be in project route
 - station_gen.py takes manual input or cached info in data/stations_raw to generate data in data/signals
 - data/lines outlines the route and behaviour of a line in general

For now you'll have to look at the files themselves if you want to know more about them. It's just a bunch of .json files.
